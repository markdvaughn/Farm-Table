# 🧱 BUILD SEQUENCE

---

### 1️⃣ Milling & Prep

1. Select dry, straight boards; acclimate indoors 48–72 hours.
2. Plane the 2×10 and 2×4 tabletop boards to **~1¼″ thick**; lightly joint edges if needed.
3. Cut all parts to final length; label each piece.
4. Drill all **pocket holes** in the ends of aprons and cross-stringers before assembly.

---

### 2️⃣ Tabletop Glue-Up

1. Lay out: **2×10 – 2×10 – 2×4 – 2×10 – 2×10**.
2. Alternate grain direction to minimize cupping.
3. Glue, clamp, and check flatness.
4. Trim ends square to **90″** after cure; sand flat (80 grit).

---

### 3️⃣ Build End Frames

1. Each end uses two legs, one short apron, and one bottom 4×4 stringer.
2. Pocket-screw the **31.5″ short apron** between legs, **½″ inset** from leg faces, **top edge flush** with leg tops.
3. Mark 8″ from the floor to the **bottom of the 4×4 stringer**; attach it centered between legs.
4. Fasten each stringer end with **Simpson L-Brackets + structural screws** (two brackets per stringer).

---

### 4️⃣ Install Long Stretcher

1. Cut the **82″ stretcher** and **notch each short 4×4 stringer** (1¾″ deep × 3½″ wide).
2. Seat the stretcher in the notches; it should project **2″ beyond** each outer stringer face.
3. Secure from underneath with L-Brackets or through-screws.
4. This creates a visually solid “through-beam” farmhouse look.

---

### 5️⃣ Connect End Frames with Long Aprons

1. Pocket-screw the **71″ long aprons** between the leg sets, **½″ inset** from leg faces, top edge flush with leg tops.
2. Confirm the base measures **78″ × 38.5″** (outer-to-outer) and is square.

---

### 6️⃣ Add Cross-Stringers

1. Pocket-screw **two 35″ 2×4 cross-stringers** between the long aprons, **flush with top edge**.
2. Space them evenly (≈ 22–23″ from each end).
3. These strengthen the top and provide mounting points for figure-8 fasteners.

---

### 7️⃣ Fit Base to Top

1. Place base upside-down on the underside of the top.
2. Center for **6″ end overhang** and **1″ side overhang**.
3. Mark apron outlines and figure-8 fastener locations (every 10–12″).
4. Mark **C-channel** positions (10–12″ from each end, inside apron perimeter).

---

### 8️⃣ Rout & Install C-Channels

1. Rout slots **5⁄16″ deep × 2 ¹⁄₁₆″ wide**, perpendicular to the grain.
2. Drill **elongated holes** in channels (along the grain).
3. Screw channels flush with #10 × ¾″ screws or use threaded inserts.

---

### 9️⃣ Attach Top

1. Mount figure-8 fasteners to aprons and cross-stringers.
2. Flip base onto the underside of top; secure fasteners to the tabletop (allow movement).

---

### 🔟 Sand & Finish

1. Sand all surfaces: 80 → 120 → 180 → 220 grit.
2. Break sharp edges slightly for comfort.
3. Apply desired stain or oil; seal with matte polyurethane or hard-wax oil.
4. Add felt pads or glides under legs.
